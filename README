We used beejs.pdf for some basic functions.

sender.cpp :
	sender.cpp <SenderPort> <ReceiverPort> <RetransmissionTimer> <NoOfPacketsToBeSent>
	
	sockfd_s : socket descriptor corresponding to the Receiver Port
	sockfd_l : socket descriptor corresponding to the Sender Port
	
	nm : Num of Packets whose valid Acknowledgements have been received - 1.
	
	
receiver.cpp : 
	receiver.cpp <ReceiverPort> <SenderPort> <PacketeDropProbability>
	
	sockfd_l : socket descriptor corresponding to the Receiver Port
	sockfd_s : socket descriptor corresponding to the Sender Port
	
	i : Num Of Acknowledgements Validated by the sender -1.
	str1 : The Received String
	ind : The Sequence Number of the Packet Received.
